# About This Project

For my final project for Intro to Probability and Statistics (MTH/SDS 220), my group and I focused on fact check ratings for facebook articles. The objective of our project was to answer the question "Does the type of post, number of comments, political category, content and/or fact check rating have an effect on the number of times a news story post will be shared on Facebook?"

Partners: Lauryn Aliwalas and Xela Miller
(Note: Our group name was "group-c", hence the file naming conventions)

Included in this repository are the project proposal, data appendix and project report.

Language of focus: R

# Project Instructions
(as stated by professor)
You will conduct a statistical study on a topic of your choice. This task will require you to write a project proposal, acquire and analyze relevant data, present your results orally to the class, and hand in a written report describing your study and its findings. Your project must involve fitting a multiple regression model. The project is an opportunity to show off what youâ€™ve learned about data analysis, visualization, and statistical inference. It is a major component of the class, and successful completion is required to pass.
